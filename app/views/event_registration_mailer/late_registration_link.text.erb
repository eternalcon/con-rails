Hi there!

Looks like you have been in contact with Pittel in order to snatch one of the last available spaces at <%= @event_registration.event.name %>...
Apparently, you have been lucky! You will be part of the fun soon enough!

But before that, we still need some information about you and your party.

Just head over to <%= url_for late_registration_event_event_registrations_url(@event_registration.event_id, locale: 'en', registration_token: @event_registration.registration_token) %> and fill in the required information.
After your data has been processed, you will receive an additional mail with payment information and everything else you need to know.

If you haven't registered a user account for The Eternal Con Website yet, you should probably do so first at <%= url_for new_user_registration_url %>. Otherwise, you would get redirected to the registration page and have to come back to this e-mail after confirming your registration to access the link again.
If you already have registered your user account, just go ahead!


Enjoy the party!

The Eternal Convention Crew
