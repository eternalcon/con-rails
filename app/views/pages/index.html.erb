      <p class="sub">What is a Freeform?</p>
      <p class="copy">A freeform is a type of roleplaying game with minimal rules and can have as many as 50 players (or more) playing simultaneously. A freeform game (of the type held at Eternal Con) typically lasts 4 to 7 hours. Costuming is typically encouraged. In a freeform you play a premade character (although in some freeforms you may be asked to help make your character); this character typically has goals, likes, and dislikes, and some background to get you in the mindset of your character. In a freeform, you interact with the other players to accomplish your goals, chew scenery, and general have a grand fun time. The referees are there to resolve any "out-of-character" problems (like "did I manage to block his laser beam attack?"), otherwise it is up to you!<br/>
    Previous freeforms by the writers at Eternal Con have included Cthulhu-esque horror mysteries, the Succession Wars of Alexander the Great, the Second Crusade, and epic fantasy freeforms set in Greg Stafford's world of Glorantha.</p>

      <p class="sub">What is Trollball?</p>
      <p class="copy">Trollball is a family friendly freeform game. It is similar to Rugby but played in slow motion. All players play two teams of huge trolls wielding foam clubs. Each team has to get the "ball" behind the opponent's goal line. The team with the most goals wins. No language skills are necessary but shouting and roaring like a troll would be cool.</p>
      <p class="copy">The game lasts for about one hour. For the full rule set and a T-shirt see <a href="http://www.trollball.eu">www.trollball.eu</a>.</p>
